# spotify-power-search

My first prototype using FramerJS. I wanted to try FramerJS with an app I use often, Spotify. I search often on the app, so I created a solution on how to get the search screen quicker by tapping and holding the left arrow. This was one when the Spotify interface was using an off-canvas approach.
